# Salesman Management System with File Handling

The final project of COMP 20033 Computer Programming 2 written in the C Language.

---

## How it Works
This program is intended to be used as a management system to manipulate the data of employees of a sales company.

It has four functions:
1. **Add**
2. **Edit**
3. **Delete**
4. **View**

## File Handling System
This program also makes use of the File Handling System from the standard library `stdio.h`. An external file, the `database.txt` file is used to act as the database of this program.

## Error Catching System
We brainstormed for all of the possible errors and bugs that is created by mostly human error which we strive to accomplish **Garbage Input - Perfect Output (GIPO)**. This means that invalid inputs will be rejected *but* will not break the program.
